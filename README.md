Intelligent Control and Cognitive Systems coursework


09/02:
- Figure out what an intelligent robot should be able to do
- What kind of data SONAR and the light sensor provide, which will help the robot most

20/02:
- Need to move ultrasonic sensor further forwards as it is currently aligned with the 
  hweels making corner turning difficult. May need add some weight in the back of bot 
  also as it appears to be a little off balance. 

Robot functionality checklist:

Robot should be able to 
- Wander around when no wall is in sight
- Identify when close to a wall and align itself parallel to it
- Travel alongside wall
- Identify a corner which it is on the outside of and follow the wall around this corner - this is difficult
- Identify a corner which it is on the inside of and turn to keep following the wall - use light sensor for this
- Identify objects which cannot be followed but pose a risk of getting stuck and avoid them like the plague
