Intelligent Control and Cognitive Systems coursework


09/02:
- Figure out what an intelligent robot should be able to do
- What kind of data SONAR and the light sensor provide, which will help the robot most

20/02:
- Need to move ultrasonic sensor further forwards as it is currently aligned with the 
  hweels making corner turning difficult. May need add some weight in the back of bot 
  also as it appears to be a little off balance.
